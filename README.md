# hep-ml
hep-ml aims to reproduce the traditional data-analysis workflow in high-energy physics using Python. This allows us to employ the wide range of modern, flexible packages for machine learning and statistical analysis written in Python to increase the sensitivity of our analysis.

## Functionality
### Machine Learning
- [x] Deep Neural Networks - `TensorFlow`
- [x] Gradient Boosted Trees - `XGBoost`, `scikit-learn`
- [x] Hyperparameter Optimization - `scikit-learn`
- [ ] Distributed Trainingsca.djsd

### Statistical Analysis
- [ ] Signal Yield Extraction
- [ ] Precision Branching Fraction / CP Asymmetry Measurements

## Installation
#### TensorFlow
